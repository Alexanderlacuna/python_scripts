###  For each of the following scenarios describe how you would  develop an intelligent system to solve problems.

*SPAM EMAILS*
Many people experience email spam as an annoying but non-threatening experience. This testifies to the fact that today, there are powerful tools and platforms working hard to protect users from email spam.
Here are ways that AI-based tools will detect and filter spam: 

- Keyword and content-based filtering: Machine learning approaches such as Neural Networks, Naïve Bayesian classification, k-nearest neighbor(kNN), and others are used. Here, keywords, phrases, and their distribution and frequency are assessed and rules are made to filter spam email. 
- Similarity-based filtering: Here, kNN is used to classify emails based on whether they are similar to stored emails. Email attributes form a foundation and based on these, new instances are plotted as points for future emails. 
- Sample-based filtering: Machine learning algorithms are trained to detect new emails as spam or not based on training data extracted from sample mails. These sample emails are from legitimate and spam emails.  

- Adaptive email spam filtering: Here, spam emails are made into groups. Each group is represented by a token or emblematic text. These groups of representative texts are made up of words, phrases, and even meaningless strings. Incoming email is compared to these tokens or representative text and classified into spam or not-spam.

*OPTIMAL FINDING PATH BETWEEN DESTINATION*

AI the imitation or cloning of human intelligence, that allows machines, more specifically computer systems, to perform in an extremely intelligent manner. For each of the following scenarios describe how you would develop an intelligent system to solve problems.

You also use different algorithms e.g 
Dijkstra’s algorithm 

This is used for graph searches. It is optimal, meaning it will find the single shortest path. It is uninformed, meaning it does not need to know the target node before hand. In fact it finds the shortest path from every node to the node of origin. There are many possible variations of Dijkstra’s algorithm optimized for specific purposes. One example is that if a destination node is known the algorithm can be instructed to terminate once it has found the shortest path for that node. Dijkstra's algorithm can be considered a heuristic search, similar to a greedy search if the search has a known destination and it can be considered an exhaustive search when the search has no destination node and all nodes are considered. The efficient of Dijkstra’s algorithm makes it a favorite for network routing protocols. Also since essentially any combinatorial optimization problem can be formulated as a shortest path problem, Dijkstra’s algorithm is also important for AI research.

*CHATBOX*

A chatbot system uses conversational artificial intelligence (AI) technology to simulate a discussion (or a chat) with a user in natural language via messaging applications, websites, mobile apps or the telephone. It uses rule-based language applications to perform live chat functions in response to real-time user interactions

Chatbots are trained to act upon the inputs provided by consumers or they can be driven by rules. They rely on a machine’s ability to interpret human language (spoken or typed) and are trained to respond to interactions. The more data fed to the chatbot, the more human-like the response. There are two different tasks they perform:


There are different approaches and tools that you can use when building chatbots. Depending on the use case you want to address, some technologies are more appropriate than others. Combining artificial intelligence forms such as natural language processing, machine learning, and semantic understanding may be the best option to achieve the desired results.

Standard Logic Tree
These prompt-based chatbots let customers choose from a list of prompts then take them through a series of multiple-choice questions. The application will take them to the most helpful destination based on the answers. This type of chatbot is good for simple queries with a defined scope, as it limits customers to a certain number of inputs.

Keyword Recognition
This approach allows customers to submit their written inquiries. The chatbot identifies keywords from the query and directs customers to a corresponding solution. This type of chatbot can be used for a broader range of customer inquiries.

Machine Learning
This approach uses a machine learning engine to train itself to deliver an optimal response to a customer query. It learns based on past inquiries and evolves as inputs are analyzed. A large amount of data is needed to train the system, and machine learning of the chatbot application is done in a black box with no insight into what is learned.

Symbolic NLU
This approach leverages symbolic AI to provide a more conversational approach to customer service. It uses natural language technology to understand the intent of a customer query. It provides full visibility into the rules that machines use to gain knowledge, with human oversight to adjust the learning models.


*The Spotify app is a great music streaming platform that knows exactly what type
of music they like. You can learn to build a model that will analyze the users’
msic tastes and will recommend new music to them based on their interests*

based on a User model you can  model an AI that helps user get their choice
of music by analyzing their past behaviours.


*Lane line detection technique is used in many self-driving autonomous vehicles as
well as line-following robots. We can use computer vision techniques such as
color thresholding to detect the lanes.*

Lane Line detection is a critical component for self driving cars and also for computer vision in general. This concept is used to describe the path for self-driving cars and to avoid the risk of getting in another lane.

Using computer vision techniques,we can identify road lane lines in which autonomous cars must run
This will be a critical part of autonomous cars, as the self-driving cars should not cross it’s lane and should not go in opposite lane to avoid accidents.

a novel approach is proposed to detect the road lanes with high precision and accuracy by combining convolution neural networks with line detection (CNN-LD). The authors suggest a novel algorithm or pseudo code along with mathematical equations to test the efficacy and accuracy



## PART B

**Artificial Intelligence for a Better World**

With AI adoption on the rise, the technology is addressing a number of global challenges.
for example

- AI in Health care
AI tools are helping designers improve computational sophistication in health care. For example, Merantix is a German company that applies deep learning to medical issues. It has an application in medical imaging that “detects lymph nodes in the human body in Computer Tomography (CT) images.”[21] According to its developers, the key is labeling the nodes and identifying small lesions or growths that could be problematic. Humans can do this, but radiologists charge $100 per hour and may be able to carefully read only four images an hour. If there were 10,000 images, the cost of this process would be $250,000, which is prohibitively expensive if done by humans.

AI has been applied to congestive heart failure as well, an illness that afflicts 10 percent of senior citizens and costs $35 billion each year in the United States.

- Criminal justice

AI is being deployed in the criminal justice area. The city of Chicago has developed an AI-driven “Strategic Subject List” that analyzes people who have been arrested for their risk of becoming future perpetrators. It ranks 400,000 people on a scale of 0 to 500, using items such as age, criminal activity, victimization, drug arrest records, and gang affiliation. In looking at the data, analysts found that youth is a strong predictor of violence, being a shooting victim is associated with becoming a future perpetrator, gang affiliation has little predictive value, and drug arrests are not significantly associated with future criminal activity
Judicial experts claim AI programs reduce human bias in law enforcement and leads to a fairer sentencing system. R Street Institute Associate Caleb Watney writes:


- Transportation 

Transportation represents an area where AI and machine learning are producing major innovations. Research by Cameron Kerry and Jack Karsten of the Brookings Institution has found that over $80 billion was invested in autonomous vehicle technology between August 2014 and June 2017. Those investments include applications both for autonomous driving and the core technologies vital to that sector

Autonomous vehicles—cars, trucks, buses, and drone delivery systems—use advanced technological capabilities. Those features include automated vehicle guidance and braking, lane-changing systems, the use of cameras and sensors for collision avoidance, the use of AI to analyze information in real time, and the use of high-performance computing and deep learning systems to adapt to new circumstances through detailed maps


- Smart cities
Metropolitan governments are using AI to improve urban service delivery.



- Security

AI plays a substantial role in national defense. Through its Project Maven, the American military is deploying AI “to sift through the massive troves of data and video captured by surveillance and then alert human analysts of patterns or when there is abnormal or suspicious activity.”

The big data analytics associated with AI will profoundly affect intelligence analysis, as massive amounts of data are sifted in near real time—if not eventually in real time—thereby providing commanders and their staffs a level of intelligence analysis and productivity heretofore unsee

 **Artificial Intelligence in Tourism**
Competition in the travel and tourism industry is very high. You must have seen that prices
keep on fluctuating and change often. You might have also booked a flight ticket in advance
or have waited just before the departure date to find cheaper tickets. Everyone does that, but
the struggle is minimized with AI. With predictive analytics driven by artificial intelligence,
the price can be predicted. The application is able to predict price patterns and alert travellers
when to buy the tickets. So, the cheapest rate can be known before you book the flights to
your destination. The price trend is analyzed on the basis of the recorded data on each route.
So, you get notifications of when to book your flight. Book it at the right time and at the right
price and say thanks to artificial intelligence.





The capacity for artificial intelligence to perform tasks that have traditionally required human cognitive function has made it especially useful for those in the travel industry, because deploying AI can save businesses time and money, while potentially eliminating human error and allowing tasks to be performed quickly, at any time of the day.

Most hotels and resorts rely heavily on delivering excellent customer service to build their reputation and AI technology can assist with this in a wide variety of different ways. For example, artificial intelligence can be used to improve personalisation, tailor recommendations and guarantee fast response times, even in the absence of staff.

Artificial intelligence has advanced to the point where it is regularly used to assist and communicate with customers, ‘learning’ from each of these interactions and improving future interactions as a result. Moreover, AI can assist with tasks like data analysis, calculations and problem solving, all of which can be valuable to hotel owners

*Examples of   AI Within the Travel Industry*


- Chatbots and Online Customer Service
hotels and other businesses in the tourism industry, one of the most exciting uses for artificial intelligence is for providing assistance to customers online. In particular, there has already been widespread adoption for the purposes of powering chatbots on social media platforms, as well as instant messaging apps.


- Face-to-Face Customer Service

 While the use of artificial intelligence for powering online customer service is now relatively commonplace, one of the emerging trends is for the technology to be used for face-to-face customer service interactions too. Crucially, this has the ability to cut queues at information or reception desks, and improve overall efficiency


-  Data Processing and Data Analysis

t is important to understand that the applications of AI within the travel and tourism industry are not limited to customer service alone. In actual fact, one of its most popular and effective uses is for gathering and interpreting data in order to draw conclusions about customers, business practices and pricing strategies.

The key advantage of artificial intelligence in this particular field is its ability to sort through huge amounts of data quickly and accurately, where the equivalent for humans would take significantly more time and potentially contain more errors. The Dorchester Collection hotel, for instance, has used AI to sort through customer feedback from surveys, reviews and online polls, in order to build a clearer picture of current opinion, in real-time.
